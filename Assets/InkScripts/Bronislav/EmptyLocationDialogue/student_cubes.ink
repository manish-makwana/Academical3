The graduate student offices are mostly quiet. Faint sounds of keyboards clacking and pens scratching can be heard within the maze of cubicles.

You get restless and decide to socialize - but everyone seems to be deep in work with their noise-cancelling headphones on.
You decide it's best not to disturb anyone.
