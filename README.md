Academical 3.0 is rendition of the experimental research game *Academical*, originally made using Twine. Academical is an educational game that teaches players about the Responsible Conduct of Research and ethics. In this version, players must do their best to resolve scenarios that place ethical decision making in conflict with navigating social relationships. The design is meant to showcase how ethical decision-making is more difficult when you factor in the social realities realities of the workplace (friendships, power imbalances, personal goals, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Local Environment

1. Clone the repository into the folder of your choosing.
2. Install [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com). This is needed to load the game assets like images and music.
3. Set up Git LFS for your system with `git lfs install`.
4. Ensure assets are downloaded correctly with `git lfs pull`.
5. Open the project in Unity. This will require downloading Unity version 2022.3.56f1 (this is handled automatically by Unity Hub when you open the project).
6. Inside Unity, switch to the "MainMenu" scene (Assets/Scenes/MainMenu).
7. Ensure that Ink has compiled. This can be done through the engine menu at Assets > Recompile Ink. You should see the file "main.json" appear under Assets/Resources/. If you do not see this file, your local environment will not run and you need to recompile Ink.
